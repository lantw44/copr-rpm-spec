Subject: [PATCH] Demand for newer POSIX macro

Reason for change: Define _POSIX_C_SOURCE such that it demands correct
posix interfaces, netdb.h declares interfaces such as
getaddrinfo if __USE_POSIX, i.e. POSIX.1:1990 or later.
However, these interfaces were new in the 2001 edition of POSIX
therefore ask for Extension from POSIX.1:2001 since we use addrinfo
structure here.
