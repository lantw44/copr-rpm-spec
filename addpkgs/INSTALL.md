[GNU Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/)
--------
The post-install script will create an user and a group called `guix-builder`. If you want more users for building packages, add more users to the `guix-builder` group. Start the `guix-daemon` by running command `guix-daemon --build-users-group=guix-builder` as root, and you can start using guix. `guix-daemon` will create most necessary files and directories when you first using it.
