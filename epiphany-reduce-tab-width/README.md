Reduce the minimum tab width in the GNOME Web browser, so you can see more tabs
on the screen without scrolling.

_Note: This repository will not be maintained for Fedora 34 and later versions.
Epiphany 40 changes the way it implements tabs. Tabs become much more compact
than previous versions, so it is no longer needed to reduce the default width._
