Latest version of GNU Binutils, GCC, GLIBC which support cross-compiling for
GNU/Linux running on 32-bit ARM CPU. Binaries built by this toolchain should be
able to run on Fedora ARM.

Specs used to build packages in this repository are largely based on scripts
provided by [crosstool-NG](http://crosstool-ng.org/). All packages are built
directly from upstream tarballs without patches.
