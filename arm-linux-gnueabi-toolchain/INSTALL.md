`yum install arm-linux-gnueabi-{binutils,gcc,glibc}`

GDB is not included because `gdb` package provided by Fedora can also be used to
debug GNU/Linux programs running on ARM.

Although this repository may provide packages for several versions of Fedora and
EPEL, only the latest stable version of Fedora (currently Fedora 21) is tested.
