My Personal Packages for Fedora
-------------------------------

Most packages are available as RPMs and SRPMs on [Fedora Copr](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/lantw44/). Some packages may not be available because of legal issues, and you will need to build it from the RPM spec file if you want to use it.
