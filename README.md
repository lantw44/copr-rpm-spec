My Personal Packages for Fedora
-------------------------------

Most packages are available as RPMs and SRPMs on [Fedora Copr](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/lantw44/). All packages should work on the latest stable release of Fedora.


Reporting Bugs or Contributing Patches
--------------------------------------
If you find packaging error in my packages, please send problem reports or patches to me via email or IRC. You can find my email address in git commit log or changelog section of any RPM spec file. As this git repository is mirrored on GitHub, you can also use GitHub issue or pull request to report problems.
